- Fixed an issue with BagSync Warband Bank Support  
    * Warband Bank data should no longer vanish or empty when logging in different characters.  The data will only be scanned when visiting a bank or using the warband bank convergence.  Blizzard was sending Warband Bank events even during login which was clearing all the data.  (Fixes #363)
