[Full Changelog](https://github.com/Xruptor/BagSync/compare/v19.54...v19.55) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/Xruptor/BagSync/releases)

- Updated BagSync ParseLink Method  
    * Updated the way that BagSync parses the ItemLinks to be more accurate for future updates by Blizzard to ItemLinks  (https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/ItemLink)  
    * This update only really applies to those whom use the Unique ItemID option on.  To those whom have it off, it shouldn't really affect you.  
    * May require you logging in to the characters again to update the database data.
