- Fix for Cataclysm Classic Tooltips not working  
    * Thanks to @lox whom helped me debug it, I fixed the issue with Cataclysm Classic tooltips not displaying.  Apparently Blizzard broke their own tooltip processor, go figure.  (Fixes #333)  
- License Update  
    * The license needed to be updated a bit.
