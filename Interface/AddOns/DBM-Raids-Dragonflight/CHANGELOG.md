# <DBM Mod> Raids (DF)

## [10.2.21](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/tree/10.2.21) (2024-02-03)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/compare/10.2.20...10.2.21) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/releases)

- prep new tag for retail  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#407)  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#406)  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#405)  
- reduce transparency of dropdown menus to make it easier to read options in them. With recent UI updates, background tect in many places changed from a softer yellow to a strong white, as a result it could be difficult to read dropdown items in sound and timer color menus. This balances that out.  
- re-arrange, at least in the languages that actually have dropdown localizations  
- I didn't like how unclear this is, so make it clearer that the default 4 sounds selected in sound drop downs, are the global sounds (as configured in the special announce panel)  
- GUI: Hide boss preview when changing tabs.  
- More GUI cleaning... Fixed a few bugs.  
- Apply to correct OnShow :D  
- Cleaner fix mayb?  
- GUI: Fix quirky non-positioning issue when resizing WoW window?  
- Abort skip if nil map ID. Closes https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/issues/986  
- bump alpha
